Current plan: Brute force TSP

# My initial setup

```sh
npm init

npx create-react-app server

npm install express axios path serve-static itertools http-proxy-middleware@2.0.1
```

# Run

```sh
node app.js
```

And in another instance:

```sh
cd server/
npm start
```

# Future plans

Use `systemd` to run as a background service?
